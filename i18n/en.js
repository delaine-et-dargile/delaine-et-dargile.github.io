    clayDescription:
      'The first step is to weigh the necessary amount depending on which piece I want to make. Then I work the clay to avoid air bubbles that can make the piece explode during cooking.',
    tournageDescription:
      'The two major sub-stages are to center the clay, then to shape and actually make the desired shape of our piece. I make all the pieces by hand, trying to bring a touch and an incomparable soul to each piece.',
    tournassageDescription:
      "Trimming removes excess clay from the base to create a foot for the piece. You can also round off the base and take over the edges. It's also at this stage that we can add handles for mugs, or make decorations. We work the piece on the lathe, once it has a good consistency, almost leather-like.",
    firstCuissonDescription:
      'After the piece has completely dried, it\'s sent to the kiln for a first firing, in order to be "bisque fired". Our electric kiln runs firing programs up to 1050°C in 16 hours to ensure the correct firing of the pieces.',
    emaillageDescription:
      "The glaze is a mixture of different elements, mainly silica and metal oxides for colors, to which water will be added. This preparation is applied on our piece which being very porous will suck water and leave our glaze on the surface. Glaze has an aesthetic function but also utilitarian: it decorates a piece, but also makes the object suitable for food consumption. Glazing is therefore a finishing step that makes a ceramic object non-porous, smooth and hygienic. It’s also the part I like least, because there's the chance factor, and a probability of making a piece unusable.",
    secondCuissonDescription:
      "To reveal the piece's glaze, we will put our object in the kiln to fire it a second time. This second firing will melt our glaze to reveal the color and thus get our piece finished. After this second firing comes the long-awaited time of opening the kiln. Every time it's a bit of a rollercoaster of emotions because we finally discover the result of our work, and surprises are always there, sometimes good, sometimes bad, but we definitely always learn.",

    aboutMeDescription:
      "Welcome to my world ! My name is Marie and I'm from France. I was first introduced to ceramics when I studied abroad in the US and fell in love with it. Crochet came a little bit later but makes my heart as warm and fuzzy as pottery does. Never creating the same piece twice, each creation is unique and handmade with care. Each collection is produced in small series at different periods of my life, evolving with my journey. I hope that my creations will bring a touch of authenticity and warmth to your daily life.",
